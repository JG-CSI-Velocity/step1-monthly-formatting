## Phase Details

### Phase 11: Repo Reset and Cleanup
**Goal**: Local repo matches GitHub exactly at commit a314c50 with zero leftover v1.0 artifacts
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.1)
**Requirements**: REPO-01, REPO-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `git status` in the local repo shows a clean working tree with no untracked files outside the a314c50 structure
  2. Running `git log -1` shows commit a314c50 (or a descendant with only the reset commit)
  3. No velocity/ package directory, no manifest YAML files, no v1.0 UI pages exist in the working tree
**Plans**: 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md -- Hard reset to a314c50, clean v1.0 artifacts, user verification

### Phase 12: Folder Structure
**Goal**: GitHub repo has the 00-05 numbered directory layout that mirrors M:\ARS\ exactly, with config and UI files in their correct locations
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: FOLD-01, FOLD-02, FOLD-03, FOLD-04, FOLD-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Directories 02_Presentations/, 03_Config/, 04_Logs/, and 05_UI/ exist on GitHub after push
  2. ars_config.json and settings.py are in 03_Config/ (not nested under 00_Formatting/00-Scripts/configs/)
  3. FastAPI app.py and all static UI files are under 05_UI/ (ui/ directory no longer exists)
  4. Running `ls` at repo root shows 00_Formatting, 01_Analysis, 02_Powerpoint, 02_Presentations, 03_Config, 04_Logs, 05_UI as the primary structure
  5. Work PC can `git pull` this commit and see the same folder layout as M:\ARS\
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md -- Create 03_Config/, move config files, update import paths
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md -- Create remaining dirs, copy 02_Powerpoint, move UI, delete mockups, push gate

### Phase 13: TXN Merge Batch 1
**Goal**: First 11 TXN section folders (general through transaction_type) are merged into 01_Analysis/00-Scripts/analytics/ with overlap modules kept separate
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: TXN-03, TXN-04, TXN-05, TXN-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Folders general/, merchant/, mcc_code/, business_accts/, personal_accts/, competition/, financial_services/, ics_acquisition/, campaign/, branch_txn/, transaction_type/ exist under 01_Analysis/00-Scripts/analytics/
  2. ARS attrition/ is untouched and TXN attrition scripts go to attrition_txn/ (both directories exist side by side)
  3. ARS rege/ is untouched and TXN rege scripts go to rege_overdraft/ (both directories exist side by side)
  4. ARS mailer/ is untouched and TXN campaign scripts go to campaign/ (both directories exist side by side)
  5. 00-setup scripts are placed in shared/ or 03_Config/ as utility files with .py extensions
**Plans:** 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 13-01-PLAN.md -- Copy 12 TXN folders (238 scripts) with .py extensions, push gate

### Phase 14: TXN Merge Batch 2
**Goal**: Remaining 11 TXN section folders (product through executive) are merged, completing the full 22-folder TXN integration
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: TXN-01, TXN-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Folders product/, attrition_txn/, balance/, interchange/, rege_overdraft/, payroll/, relationship/, segment_evolution/, retention/, engagement/, executive/ exist under 01_Analysis/00-Scripts/analytics/
  2. All 22 TXN folders are present under 01_Analysis/00-Scripts/analytics/ (verified by count)
  3. All 332 TXN scripts have .py extensions (no extensionless files remain)
  4. Work PC can `git pull` this commit and see the complete TXN folder structure
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 15: Setup Parameterization
**Goal**: TXN setup scripts accept any client ID and read transaction files from the standard monthly client folder (not hardcoded paths)
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: PARAM-01, PARAM-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. No TXN setup script contains a hardcoded reference to client 1776 or "CoastHills"
  2. TXN file paths resolve from the same folder structure as ODD files (00_Formatting/02-Data-Ready for Analysis/{CSM}/{YYYY.MM}/{client_id}/)
  3. Running a TXN setup script with a different client ID (e.g., 1200) produces correct path resolution without errors
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 16: Verification
**Goal**: The merged repo works correctly -- existing ARS pipeline runs without errors and each folder commit pulls cleanly on the work PC
**Depends on**: Phase 14, Phase 15
**Requirements**: VERIF-01, VERIF-02, VERIF-03, VERIF-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running the ARS formatting pipeline (00_Formatting/run.py) produces the same output as before the merge
  2. Running the ARS analysis modules (01_Analysis/run.py) produces the same output as before the merge
  3. Running PowerPoint generation (02_Powerpoint/) produces a valid PPTX from analysis results
  4. Each phase (11-15) was committed and pushed separately, and the work PC successfully pulled each one
**Plans**: TBD

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
v1.1: 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16

### Phase 17: End-to-End Orchestration & Scheduling
**Goal:** Single-command or single-button pipeline that chains formatting -> analysis (ARS + TXN) -> PowerPoint generation for one client/month. Include scheduling support so CSMs can set up recurring runs (e.g., monthly auto-generate for their clients). Also: cache API responses (CSM list, months, clients) so UI loads instantly instead of scanning M: drive on every request -- critical for remote/slow connections.
**Depends on:** Phase 16
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** TBD

### Phase 18: Slide Layout Refinement (All Sections)
**Goal:** Go section by section through SLIDE_MANIFEST.xlsx and refine chart sizing, positioning, text, and styling for all slides -- both ARS and TXN. Iterative process with JG review per section.
**Depends on:** Phase 16
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** TBD

### Phase 19: Overnight Formatting Sweep
**Goal:** Background thread in app.py that auto-runs formatting on the 7th, 9th, and 11th of each month at midnight. Processes all CSMs/clients that haven't been formatted yet this month -- skips what's already done. Includes TXN file gathering. Start with a whitelist of CSMs (opt-in) before enabling for everyone.
**Depends on:** Phase 17
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** TBD
