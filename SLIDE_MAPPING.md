## Slide Construction Rules

### Every Slide Has Three Layers

```
TOP:     Conclusion headline (complete sentence stating the finding)
MIDDLE:  Data visual (chart rendered as PNG at 150 DPI)
BOTTOM:  Business implication (speaker note or annotation)
```

### Headline Rules

- Complete sentence with metric, magnitude, and direction
- BAD: "Debit Card Penetration by Branch"
- GOOD: "Three branches account for 62% of debit growth, led by Main Office at 23%"
- Template: `[Metric] [changed] by [X%] due to [driver], resulting in [impact]`

### Chart Rendering

- Figure size: `figsize=(13, 7)` to match slide dimensions
- DPI: 150
- Font in charts: Montserrat (set via matplotlib rcParams)
- Direct labels on data points (no legends when possible)
- Highlight focal series at full opacity, mute others to alpha=0.3
- Remove gridlines, borders, decorative elements

## Adding a New Module

1. Create analysis function that returns `AnalysisResult` with chart + data
2. Register with `@register` decorator in `analytics/`
3. Add to `MODULE_ORDER` in `registry.py`
4. Add a row to the appropriate section in this mapping doc
5. Define: headline pattern, chart type, layout index
6. The deck builder picks it up automatically
